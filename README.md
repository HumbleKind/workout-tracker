# Workout Tracker

![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/lisence-MIT-green)

## Description
This app allows users to view, create, and track workouts, each containing a subset log of multiple exercises on any given day.

Workout data is maintained in a Mongo database (with a Mongoose schema and Express routing). Each exercise logged within a workout tracks the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration. If the exercise is cardio, distance traveled is also tracked.

Users are able to:

* Add exercises to a previous workout plan.
* Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
* View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.
